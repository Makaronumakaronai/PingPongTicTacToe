PingPongTicTacToe
=================

A starting poing for ping-pong pairing tic-tac-toe excercise.

The problem:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Given board, it could be full of half full - your program should tell who is the winner?

The format:

1. Done in pairs
2. TDD style doing ping pong pairing:
    1. One person writes failing test
    2. Other implements it and writes next failing test
    3. First person makes it pass and writes next test for the pair
3. Optional. You can try doing mute pairs - no speaking, expressing yourself in tests and communicating that way

Question that would be good to think when starting:

What would be first most simple thing to test in the first test?
