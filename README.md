PingPongTicTacToe
=================

A starting poing for ping-pong pairing tic-tac-toe excercise.

The problem:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Given board, it could be full of half full - your program should tell who is the winner?

IMPORTANT: this exercise should is not intended to be finished, but rather used as exercise to practice TDD, pairing, communication.

The format:

1. Done in pairs
2. TDD style doing ping pong pairing:
    1. One person writes failing test
    2. Other implements it and writes next failing test
    3. First person makes it pass and writes next test for the pair
3. Optional. You can try doing mute pairs - no speaking, expressing yourself in tests and communicating that way

Question that would be good to think when starting:

What would be first most simple thing to test in the first test?

Three laws of TDD:

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass. 
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures. 
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
